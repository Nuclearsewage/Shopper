```

## <! -- by su guan ming -->

1. Clone repository
   Open the terminal (command prompt or PowerShell can be used on Windows, and terminal can be used on macOS and Linux), and use the git command to clone the project repository locally. Assuming the URL of the project repository is https://github.com/some-repo/shopper.git (You need to replace it with the actual repository URL), execute the following command:
   git clone https://github.com/some-repo/shopper.git
   cd shopper
   The above command clones the repository locally and enters the project directory.
2. Install dependencies
   The project uses React.exe, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, and requires the installation of front-end and back-end dependencies. Generally speaking, the dependency installation methods for front-end and back-end are slightly different. The following are common installation steps:
   Backend dependency installation
   Enter the backend project directory (usually containing the packagejson file) and execute the following command to install backend dependencies:
   npm install
   Front end dependency installation
   If there is a separate package.exe file in the frontend section, go to the frontend directory and install the dependencies:
   CD client # Assuming the frontend directory name is client
   npm install
3. Run the server
   Starting a project usually requires separately starting the front-end and back-end servers.
   Start the backend server
   In the backend project directory, execute the following command to start the backend server:
   npm start
   Start the front-end server
   In the frontend project directory, execute the following command to start the frontend development server:
   npm start

🛍️ Shopper — E-commerce Platform Optimization Plan
Based on your request to optimize the task management functionality within your e-commerce platform, I'll provide a comprehensive plan to enhance this feature while maintaining the existing e-commerce capabilities.

Current Task Management Analysis
From the screenshots and description, I can see you already have:

Basic task management functionality

Ability to add, complete, and delete tasks

Simple UI for task display

Optimization Recommendations

1. Enhanced Task Management Features
   a. Task Organization:

Add task categories/tags (e.g., "Work", "Personal", "Shopping")

Priority levels (High/Medium/Low)

Due dates with calendar integration

Subtasks for complex tasks

b. Improved UI/UX:

Drag-and-drop task reordering

Color-coded priority indicators

Progress tracking for multi-step tasks

Dark mode support

c. Advanced Functionality:

Task recurrence (daily, weekly, monthly)

Task dependencies

Task search and filtering

Bulk operations

2. Technical Implementation
   Frontend (React.js):
   // Enhanced Task Model
   const taskSchema = new Schema({
   title: { type: String, required: true },
   description: { type: String },
   completed: { type: Boolean, default: false },
   priority: { type: String, enum: ['low', 'medium', 'high'], default: 'medium' },
   dueDate: { type: Date },
   category: { type: String },
   subtasks: [{ type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Subtask' }],
   recurrence: { type: String },
   userId: { type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User', required: true },
   createdAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now }
   });

// New API endpoints needed:
// - GET /tasks?filter=completed&category=work
// - PUT /tasks/reorder (for drag-and-drop)
// - POST /tasks/bulk (for bulk operations)

Backend (Node.js/Express):
// Enhanced task controller
exports.createTask = async (req, res) => {
try {
const task = new Task({
...req.body,
userId: req.user.id
});
await task.save();
res.status(201).json(task);
} catch (error) {
res.status(400).json({ error: error.message });
}
};

// Add similar enhanced controllers for other operations 3. Integration with E-commerce Features
Potential Synergies:

Convert shopping cart items to tasks ("Need to buy these items")

Set reminders for flash sales or price drops

Task templates for common shopping routines

4. UI Mockup Suggestions
   Task List View:
   [✓] Buy groceries (High) 🛒 Due: Tomorrow - Milk - Eggs - Bread

[ ] Finish project report (Medium) 💼 Due: Fri - Research - Draft - Review

[ ] Call mom (Low) ❤️ No due date
Add Task Modal:
[ Add New Task ]
Title: [_________________________]
Description: [____________________]
Priority: [ High ● Medium ○ Low ]
Due Date: [ May 15, 2023 ▾ ]
Category: [ Personal ▾ ]
Recurrence: [ None ▾ ]
[Add Subtask] [Save Task] 5. Implementation Roadmap
Phase 1 (Core Enhancements)

Add priority levels and due dates

Implement task categories

Improve task list UI

Phase 2 (Advanced Features)

Subtasks implementation

Drag-and-drop reordering

Task search and filtering

Phase 3 (Integration)

Connect with e-commerce features

Add shopping-specific task templates

Implement reminders for cart items

Security Considerations
Maintain existing JWT authentication

Ensure proper user isolation for tasks

Add rate limiting for task API endpoints

Implement input validation for task creation/updates

## 🚀 Getting Started

Function: Executing the npm run dev command will start the project's development server. This server will compile the project code and monitor changes to project files. Once a file is modified, the server will automatically update the page to display the latest effects. After startup, you can visit http://localhost:5173 in your browser to view and use the SimpleTodo to-do list manager. This process sets up a local development and usage environment for you, facilitating operations such as function testing, development, and debugging.

Verify the project startup
After opening http://localhost:5173 in your browser, if you can see the main interface of SimpleTodo with operation buttons for adding, editing, and deleting tasks, it means the project has been successfully launched. If you encounter any problems during startup, you can check the error messages in the terminal to locate the issue. Here are some common issues and solutions:

Blank page or error: This may be due to incomplete dependency installation or syntax errors in the code. You can try deleting the node_modules directory and then re-executing npm install to install the dependencies.
Port is occupied: If the project cannot be accessed normally at http://localhost:5173 and the prompt indicates that the port is occupied, you can modify the dev script configuration in package.json to specify another available port.
After the modification, re-execute npm run dev.

Start using the project
Once the project is successfully launched and opened in the browser, you can immediately start using the SimpleTodo to-do list manager. On the main interface, you can click the corresponding buttons to add new tasks. Enter the specific content of the task in the input box and press the confirmation key to add the task to the list. For completed tasks, simply click the check box in front of the task, and the task will be marked as completed. If a task is no longer needed, you can remove it from the list by clicking the delete button. All task data will be automatically saved in the browser's LocalStorage, which means that even if you close the browser and reopen it, the previously added, edited, and deleted task data will still be retained. Moreover, thanks to the responsive interface design, you can have a good user experience whether you access the project on your phone, tablet, or PC.
